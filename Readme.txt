Stencil Buffer Usage in OpenGL: 3D Scene with Tetrahedron and Transparent Cylinder

Overview
This project demonstrates the application of stencil buffers in OpenGL for creating interactive 3D scenes. The primary goal is to render a scene containing a tetrahedron with cut-out holes in its faces using a stencil buffer. Inside the tetrahedron, a semi-transparent cylinder enclosed within a torus is rendered. The entire scene is animated to rotate using a timer, showcasing stencil buffer functionality and transparency effects.
